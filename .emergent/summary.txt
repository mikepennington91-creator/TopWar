<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested to fix a bug in the application display view. A screenshot was provided showing that long answer text was overflowing its container and had incorrect styling (large, yellow, non-wrapping text). The user also requested to pull the latest code from their GitHub repository before applying the fix due to a code conflict.

The broader product requirements from the previous session remain valid:
1.  **Animation Toggle:** A toggle switch in settings to enable/disable seasonal animations.
2.  **Server Assignment UX Upgrade:** Filtering, sorting, and a modern table-like redesign for server assignment records.
3.  **Changelog Page:** A page for logged-in moderators to view application updates.
4.  **MMOD Permissions:** Ability for MMODs to deactivate lower-ranked user accounts.
5.  **Code Refactoring:** Split up monolithic files like  and .

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack moderator recruitment and management portal. In this session, a critical UI bug was addressed. After pulling the latest code from the user's GitHub repository, the application details dialog was fixed to prevent text from overflowing its container. The fix ensures that both long questions and long answers wrap correctly within the dialog box. All previously implemented features, such as the server assignment table, changelog page, and MMOD permissions, are still present.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Fixing a UI bug on the Moderator Dashboard where long answers in the application details view were overflowing their container and not wrapping properly. The agent pulled the latest code from the user's GitHub, identified the issue in , and applied CSS classes (, ) to fix the text wrapping.
- **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?** manual testing by user or screenshot tool. The agent verified the fix with screenshots after applying it to the user's latest code.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Recurring Testing Subagent Failure (P0)**
  - This is a high-priority, recurring issue that blocks automated frontend testing and has been carried over from previous sessions.

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
  - **Description:** The  subagent consistently fails with an  error. This has occurred in previous forks and was not addressed in this session.
  - **Attempted fixes:** None in this session. The agent used manual testing (screenshots) as a workaround.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    - Examine the tool definition and expected inputs for . The error  suggests the subagent is expecting a parameter named  that is not being provided.
    - Review the agent's internal calls to the subagent to see what arguments are being passed.
    - Check the subagent's source code or documentation for its required input schema.
    - Validate the format and content of , as it serves as a primary input.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Resolving this will unblock automated frontend testing, enabling faster, more reliable verification of features and preventing regressions.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Future Tasks:**
- **Code Refactoring (P1):** The user has previously approved refactoring but deferred it. This should be addressed in the future to improve maintainability.
  - : This monolithic file has grown and should be split into a structured format (e.g., routers, models, services).
  - : This large component (over 800 lines) should be broken down into smaller, reusable child components.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Application Display Bug Fix:**
  - Pulled the latest code from the user's specified GitHub repository to resolve a code conflict.
  - Fixed a text overflow bug in .
  - Added  class to the paragraph tag rendering the application answer to ensure long text wraps correctly.
  - Added  to the  component to prevent horizontal scrolling.
  - Verified the fix using the screenshot tool, confirming that long questions and answers now wrap properly within the application detail dialog.

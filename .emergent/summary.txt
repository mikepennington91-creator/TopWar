<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
- **New Feature 1**: Add a secret page for a community supporter named Garuda with specific text and a YouTube link. Credentials:  / .
- **Bug Fix 1**: On mobile, the confirmation dialog for submitting an application does not scroll, preventing users from clicking the submit button.
- **New Feature 2**: On the application review page (), add visual indicators to show if a moderator has viewed but not voted or has already voted on an application.
- **Task 1**: Update the changelog with the application review status feature, but exclude the Garuda page.
- **Task 2**: Sync local code with changes the user made directly in GitHub (which involved manually updating the changelog content).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The Top War Moderator Management System now includes an additional easter egg page for a community member named Garuda. More significantly, the moderator dashboard for reviewing applications has been enhanced with a status tracking system. It now visually indicates whether a moderator has viewed or voted on each application, with this state persisted in the database. A bug preventing scrolling on the mobile application submission dialog has also been fixed.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent manually updated the  file to match content changes the user had made directly on GitHub, as the agent's environment had no remote  to pull from.
    - Status: NONE (COMPLETED)
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? NA
    - User Testing Done: Y

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1: The  tool is unreliable and has a history of failing. (Priority: P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent experienced a browser launch failure with the tool during this session but was able to get it working on a subsequent attempt. No root cause analysis was performed.
     - Next debug checklist: 
       - If it fails again, check the browser console logs () from the screenshot tool's environment for rendering errors.
       - Verify if there are any application-level CSS or root component issues that might affect rendering in a headless browser.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? A reliable screenshot tool is crucial for quick visual verification of frontend changes, which is faster and more efficient than running the full frontend testing agent for minor UI tweaks.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, React Hooks
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for real users, frontend-only logic for Easter egg users.

**key DB schema**
  - **applications**:
    - uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root): string
    - : string
    - : list
    - : List[str]  # NEW: Tracks which moderators have viewed the application.
    - ... (other application fields)

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- **New Files Created**:
  - 
  - 
- **Existing Files Modified**:
  - : To add the  field and tracking logic.
  - : To implement the entire view/vote status feature.
  - : To fix the mobile dialog scrolling bug.
  - : To document the new features.
  - : To add the route for the new easter egg page.
  - : To handle the new easter egg credentials.
  - : To add the favicon for the new page.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- None.

**key api endpoints**
- : Modified to add the current user's username to the application's  list upon being called.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user has demonstrated they may edit code directly on GitHub. The agent environment may not have a remote configured, so  will fail. If the user mentions external changes, ask for the specific changes to be provided so you can apply them manually.
- The screenshot tool remains flaky. It failed once in this session before working. Be prepared for it to fail and have a backup testing plan (e.g., using testing agent or ).
- When implementing features that require tracking a viewed state, ensure the frontend makes a specific API call to fetch the item's details upon user interaction (like clicking to open a modal). Simply using data already present in a list won't trigger the necessary backend logic.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has *still* not independently verified the two features pending verification from the job before last:
    1. The calendar date-picker on the  page.
    2. The  input type on the  page.
- Although the user gave a brief Both features work at the start, the agent should have performed its own verification to formally close out those items from the backlog.</analysis>
